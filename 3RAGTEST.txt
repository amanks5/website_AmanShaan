Citrus crops in Florida, particularly oranges and grapefruits, face unique pest challenges across different growth stages.

These challenges are especially prevalent in central and southern Florida.

Each pest impacts specific plant parts, and growers use targeted control methods to manage their effects.

Mites, for example, can be rust mites or spider mites and primarily affect citrus leaves and fruits.

These pests thrive in the warm, humid areas with dense canopies common in Florida’s central and southern regions.

Their primary impact is scarring and discoloration on the surface of fruits, which can lower their market quality.

To manage mite populations, growers apply miticides based on seasonal peaks and follow strict schedules to prevent resistance.

The Asian citrus psyllid, another significant pest, transmits Huanglongbing, or citrus greening disease.

This disease can be fatal to citrus trees and is particularly challenging to manage.

Southern Florida is especially affected, where the psyllid reproduces year-round, increasing the risk of disease spread.

To combat this pest, growers use systemic insecticides like imidacloprid.

Biological controls, such as the parasitoid wasp Tamarixia radiata, also help in reducing psyllid populations.

An Integrated Pest Management approach is often used to minimize chemical dependency and resistance.

Scale insects, including armored scales and soft scales, target the leaves and branches of citrus trees.

By extracting sap from trees, these pests weaken the plants and can sometimes introduce additional pathogens.

To control scale insects, growers use horticultural oils and insect growth regulators, which target the young scales.

Biological control methods encourage natural predators, like lady beetles and certain parasitoid wasps, to reduce scale populations.

Another pest, the citrus root weevil, has several species, including the Diaprepes root weevil.

These weevils attack the roots of citrus trees, which can impact nutrient absorption and lead to overall tree decline.

Biological controls, such as entomopathogenic nematodes, target weevil larvae and are complemented by soil-applied insecticides to manage adult weevils.

Leafminers, the larvae of certain moth species, are also problematic, particularly in central and southern Florida.

These pests tunnel within young citrus leaves, causing curling and distortion that impacts photosynthesis and slows tree growth.

Targeted insecticide applications, including products like abamectin and spinosad, help reduce leafminer impact while protecting beneficial insects.

Fire ants also present challenges in citrus orchards, though they are secondary pests.

They create nests near citrus roots and can worsen infestations by protecting honeydew-producing pests, such as scales and aphids.

Bait stations and mound treatments are commonly used to control fire ant populations and minimize their impact on citrus trees.

Nematodes, specifically root-knot and citrus nematodes, primarily affect the root systems of citrus crops.

They are especially common in the sandy soils found throughout central Florida.

By disrupting water and nutrient absorption, nematodes can significantly reduce tree health and crop yield.

Growers use soil fumigation and nematicides to control nematode populations and implement crop rotation and cover cropping during non-productive seasons to further suppress nematode levels.

Integrated Pest Management is essential for Florida’s citrus growers to address the unique climate and pest pressures.

Regular monitoring of pest populations helps determine control thresholds, while cultural practices work to reduce pest habitats.

Through a balance of chemical and biological methods, growers aim to limit pesticide use while maintaining effective control.

Kentucky’s winter wheat is grown in rotation with corn and soybeans, which supports pest, weed, and disease management.

The typical sequence for rotation includes corn, followed by wheat, then double-crop soybean, with winter fallow to complete the cycle.

Mechanization has eased labor demands, creating a more stable production process.

Since the 1970s, Integrated Pest Management has been integral to Kentucky’s wheat farming.

This approach emphasizes regular scouting, identifying pests, and using pesticides based on economic thresholds to manage costs and pest resistance.

Primary pests and diseases in Kentucky wheat fields include Hessian flies, cereal aphids, cereal leaf beetles, and armyworms.

Diseases like powdery mildew, leaf rust, and stripe rust also pose risks to yield quality and quantity.

To manage these issues, regular scouting helps track pest populations and monitor disease spread.

For insect and mite pests, the Hessian fly, known scientifically as Maylota destructor, is a common pest.

However, it is rarely economically damaging in Kentucky, especially when planting is delayed until after the October 10-15 “fly-free” date.

Cereal aphids, including the bird cherry-oat aphid, English grain aphid, and corn leaf aphid, can impact yields by transmitting Barley Yellow Dwarf Virus.

Control thresholds are based on aphid counts per foot of row, using chemical controls like lambda-cyhalothrin (Warrior), cyfluthrin (Baythroid), and zeta-cypermethrin (Mustang Max).

The cereal leaf beetle, an invasive species affecting southern Kentucky, is managed through scouting and targeted treatments such as cyfluthrin and lambda-cyhalothrin.

Armyworms, another pest, are kept under control largely by natural predators, while pheromone traps track population shifts.

For disease management, powdery mildew is a concern during cool, damp conditions from early to mid-season.

Control measures include selecting resistant wheat varieties and managing nitrogen application levels.

Chemicals like pyraclostrobin (Headline) and propiconazole (Tilt) are also used as needed.

Leaf rust, which typically appears late in the season, often arrives in Kentucky on spores from southern states.

Control practices involve choosing resistant wheat varieties, managing rust populations, and reducing residue to limit spore spread.

Stripe rust forms yellow stripes along leaf veins in cool, moist climates, which Kentucky sometimes experiences.

Early maturing wheat and resistant varieties help in managing stripe rust outbreaks.

Pesticide applications are carefully timed based on disease thresholds and environmental factors.

Common fungicides, including azoxystrobin (Quadris), propiconazole (Tilt), and tebuconazole (Folicur), are rotated to prevent resistance.

Once harvested, grain storage is an essential part of Kentucky wheat production.

Sanitation practices keep storage areas clean and dry, while fumigants like chlorpyrifos-methyl (Storcide II) and aluminum phosphide protect stored grain from pests like the Indian meal moth.

Wildlife, including migratory waterfowl, often disrupt Kentucky wheat crops, feeding on and trampling them.

To address these challenges, post-June harvest storage conditions are adapted to high moisture levels to maintain grain quality, with insect control applied as needed.


Tomato fields in eastern Tennessee face various pest challenges, especially during peak growing seasons.

One of the most common pests is the tomato fruitworm, Helicoverpa zea, which migrates into Tennessee each year.

These larvae feed directly on tomato fruit, creating holes and internal damage that significantly reduces fruit quality and yield.

Stink bugs, specifically Euschistus servus and Acrosternum hilare, are also frequent visitors to these fields.

These pests pierce the fruit, causing discoloration and hard spots that downgrade the market quality of tomatoes.

Because they often hide in field debris, stink bugs can be challenging to manage.

Thrips, including Franklinellia fusca and F. occidentalis, target tomato flowers and developing fruit, leaving blemishes, scarring, and sometimes causing fruit to drop.

These tiny insects also carry plant viruses, which can worsen the crop’s condition.

Aphids, like Macrosiphum euphoribae and Myzus persicae, infest tomato plants by clustering on new growth, which leads to yellowing and curling of the leaves.

Aphids produce honeydew, which encourages sooty mold and attracts additional pests to the plants.

Colorado potato beetles, known for feeding on tomato foliage, weaken plants by defoliating them and reducing overall plant health and productivity.

Another pest, flea beetles, chew holes in leaves, leaving a distinct “shothole” appearance.

Severe infestations by flea beetles can lead to major leaf loss, impacting plant vigor, especially in younger tomato plants.

Fungal diseases are also a concern, with powdery mildew and leaf rust being particularly harmful.

These diseases target the foliage, reducing the plant’s ability to photosynthesize and affecting growth and fruit production, ultimately impacting the yield.

In Louisiana’s sugarcane fields, several insect pests and diseases threaten crop health and yield.

The sugarcane borer, Diatraea saccharalis, is the most damaging pest, causing 90% of insect-related losses.

These larvae tunnel into sugarcane stalks, which weakens the plant, stunts growth, and reduces weight, often killing buds and leaving plants more vulnerable to disease.

The Mexican rice borer, identified in Calcasieu Parish, poses a serious threat and is under close watch to prevent it from spreading more widely.

Wireworms target sugarcane roots, stunting plant growth.

They persist in fields even during the off-season, making them difficult to control.

Louisiana sugarcane also faces various diseases.

Leaf scald causes bleaching and yellowing on leaves, which is worsened by drought and can lead to plant death.

Mosaic virus creates pale, irregular patterns on leaves, with symptoms most visible on young leaves.

Ratoon stunting disease stunts plant growth, causing stalk discoloration, especially under drought conditions.

Red rot affects seed cane, causing rot at nodes and internodes, with conditions like drought or waterlogging accelerating its spread.

Brown rust results in chlorotic flecks that develop into pustules on leaves, leading to premature leaf die-off.

Smut produces black, whip-like structures at the stalk tips, which narrows the shoots.

Non-infectious disorders like white stripe and yellow leaf cause striping and yellowing along the mid-vein, mainly affecting young leaves.

Moving on to North Carolina, tobacco crops face different insect pests that harm leaf quality and yield.

Hornworms consume significant amounts of foliage, defoliating plants and lowering both the quality and quantity of the harvest.

Tobacco budworms, Heliothis virescens, damage tobacco by feeding on leaves, which stunts plant growth and leads to sucker formation, requiring additional labor to remove unwanted shoots.

Green peach aphids, Myzus persicae, produce honeydew that attracts sooty mold, staining leaves and further reducing crop quality.

Flea beetles, Epitrix hirtipennis, create distinct “shot holes” in leaves, which impairs photosynthesis and stunts growth, especially in seedlings.

Wireworms attack the roots, weakening plants and causing stunted growth, particularly damaging young plants and new seedlings due to their root-feeding habits.

Tobacco thrips are vectors for the tomato spotted wilt virus, which stunts growth and can lead to plant death, contributing to yield loss.

Occasionally, white fringed beetles may chew on tobacco leaves, affecting their quality and yield.

Japanese beetles also skeletonize leaves, disrupting photosynthesis and overall plant health, often appearing in high numbers during the growing season.

In North Carolina, strawberry crops face several insect and mite pests, each impacting the fruit’s quality and yield.

Sap beetles, Carpophilus lugubris, are primary pests, feeding directly on ripe strawberries.

These beetles introduce decay organisms into the fruit, which spoils it and reduces its marketability.

The spotted wing drosophila, Drosophila suzukii, affects ripening strawberries by laying eggs within the fruit.

As the larvae develop inside, they cause internal decay, making the berries unmarketable.

Another pest, the strawberry bud weevil, Anthonomus signatus, also known as the “clipper weevil,” damages flower buds by clipping them off, leading to significant yield loss.

The tarnished plant bug, Lygus lineolaris, feeds on developing strawberries, causing deformed, “cat-faced” fruit that lowers the crop’s quality and aesthetic appeal.

Both cyclamen mites and two-spotted spider mites attack strawberry leaves, causing stippling and potential plant decline, particularly harmful when infestations are high.

Strawberries also face key diseases.

Gray mold, Botrytis cinerea, is a common cause of post-harvest fruit rot, particularly in high-humidity conditions, leading to substantial spoilage.

Anthracnose, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, can severely impact yield and quality by causing fruit rot, particularly in susceptible strawberry varieties.

Red stele, Phytophthora fragariae, a soil-borne pathogen, thrives in poorly drained soils, leading to root rot and plant decline, ultimately reducing the yield.

Moving to North Carolina’s sorghum crops, several primary pests impact plant health and productivity.

The sugarcane aphid, Melanaphis sacchari, is a critical pest that feeds on sorghum leaves and stalks.

It secretes honeydew, encouraging fungal growth that affects grain fill and overall plant health.

Corn earworms, Helicoverpa zea, and fall armyworms, Spodoptera frugiperda, are caterpillars that attack grain heads directly, reducing yield and crop quality.

The greenbug, Schizaphis graminum, and yellow sugarcane aphid, Sipha flava, are minor pests.

However, they can cause wilting and promote mold growth, which affects crop vitality.

Sorghum also faces specific diseases.

Anthracnose, Colletotrichum spp., produces tan lesions with darker borders on sorghum foliage, especially in high-moisture conditions.

Leaf spot, Gloeocercospora sorghi, creates target-like lesions on leaves, particularly in areas with frequent rainfall.

Root rot, Rhizoctonia spp., causes root decay and seedling mortality, especially in cool, damp soil conditions, significantly impacting early plant growth.

In North Carolina, blackberry crops face several primary pests that impact plant health and fruit quality.

The brown marmorated stink bug, an invasive pest, feeds on blackberry fluids through piercing-sucking mouthparts.

This process can damage the fruit and introduce an unpleasant odor, affecting its marketability.

Another pest, the Japanese beetle, skeletonizes blackberry leaves, weakening plants and making them more vulnerable to fungal infections.

The spotted wing drosophila lays eggs just beneath the fruit’s skin, where larvae development damages the blackberry and introduces decay.

Green June beetles are also a concern, gouging ripe blackberries and leaving excrement, which reduces the fruit’s marketability.

The strawberry bud weevil, active in early spring, clips blackberry buds, leading to bud loss and potential yield reduction.

The green stink bug uses similar piercing-sucking feeding techniques, causing leaf dimpling and scarring that reduce the blackberry’s quality.

Flower thrips, which feed within blackberry flowers, may lead to minor deformities or contamination of the fruit.

The raspberry cane borer girdles blackberry canes, which interrupts nutrient flow, causing wilting and reducing the plant’s productivity.

Several diseases also affect blackberry plants.

Anthracnose results in cankers on blackberry canes and leaves, which impacts plant health and can lead to yield loss.

Botrytis, or gray mold, is a common cause of post-harvest fruit rot, particularly in high-humidity conditions.

Orange rust, a systemic disease, affects the entire plant, producing orange spores on leaves and significantly reducing yield.

Cane and leaf rust appear on floricanes, potentially impacting plant vigor and fruiting if not managed.

Fire blight is another disease of concern, characterized by crook-shaped leaves and potential bacterial ooze, which can weaken the blackberry plant and reduce its yield potential.
